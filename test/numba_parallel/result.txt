Conclusion :
  vectorize :
    1. target='cpu'       --> single thread, sequentially calculating each element in input array
    2. target='parallel'  --> multi thread, parallelly (unorderd) calculating each element in input array
  njit:
    1. parallel=True      --> multi thread, need nb.prange to explicitly specity which loop is paralell (unordered)
